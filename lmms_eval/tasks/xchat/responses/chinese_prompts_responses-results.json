However, it does not directly address the specifics of the sea duck's diet within the Chesapeake Bay, namely the importance of bivalves. Additionally, the response lacks detail on specific foraging behaviors, such as diving for food, and does not clearly link the described strategies to the Chesapeake Bay's unique food web. While there is mention of predator awareness and some migration behavior, the response could benefit from more explicit details aligning to the specific ecological niche within the Bay's ecosystem.\n\nThe response does acknowledge several factors related to the sea duck's survival but falls short in comprehensively detailing these with the same specificity found in the reference answer.

        "feedback": "The response describes the progression of semiconductor technology as depicted in the graph, focusing on specific technological milestones over time. However, it does not mention Moore's Law, its connection to the graph, or the significance of the trend shown in the graph. There is also no reference to the logarithmic scale or an explanation of exponential growth trends related to transistor counts. The response fails to provide meaningful insights into why these developments matter in the context of Moore's Law or their implications for the future. Thus, it lacks the essential elements required by the rubric that would demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the theoretical connection of the graph.\n\n[RESULT] 1",
